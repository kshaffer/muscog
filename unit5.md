## Assignments

Choose *one core concept from Unit 3* and *one core concept from Unit 4*. Write a paragraph explanation of each concept with a musical example, and upload as a MS Word doc or a PDF file to the D2L dropbox. (See [Assignment guide](/assessments) for details.)

Go to the [class wiki project hub](http://muscogwiki.cubouldermusictheory.com). Find three posts *on different core concepts than the ones you posted on Wednesday* that you think are solid, or pretty close. Copy them to your own site (following the instructions on the [Wiki Project Guide](/wikiproject/)), and make any revisions you think they require in order to be up-to-standard.

Finally, submit your Week 2 self-reflection to the D2L dropbox. (See [Assignment guide](/assessments) for details.)
