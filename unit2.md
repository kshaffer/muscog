## Unit introduction

What is a musical note? a chord? rhythm? Do musicians define these differently than cognitive scientists? What exactly do we *hear* when we listen to music?

We will continue to engage these and other related questions from [Unit 1](/unit1/) during this unit, as we further explore the workings of the human auditory system and basic musical concepts.


## Core concepts

In this unit, we will explore the following core concepts:

- (musical) events  
- echoic memory  
- primitive auditory grouping  
- learned auditory grouping  
- habituation  


## Assignments

Read/watch the following:

- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 2, "Echoic Memory"  
- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 3, "Grouping"  
- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 10, "Event Fusion"  

Then take **Quiz 2** on D2L.

Choose *one core concept from Unit 1* and *one core concept from Unit 2*. Write a paragraph explanation of each concept with a musical example, and upload as a MS Word doc or a PDF file to the D2L dropbox. (See [Assignment guide](/assessments) for details.)

Finally, submit your Week 1 self-reflection to the D2L dropbox. (See [Assignment guide](/assessments) for details.)
