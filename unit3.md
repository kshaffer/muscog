## Unit introduction

Is music really a "universal language"? This is a common claim from both musicians and music lovers — but is it true? In Units 3 and 4, we will begin to unpack which aspects of human musical practice are innate/evolved and which are learned. We will also explore small-scale cognitive functions like short-term and working memory, and their implications for human music.

## Core concepts

In this unit, we will explore the following core concepts:

- musical notes  
- musical chords  
- musical intervals  

## Assignments
